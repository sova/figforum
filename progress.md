  buddy-sign and buddy-auth

So yeah what else....

once there is authentication (nf, go, fb, tw) then let's focus on thread+comments
(question + discussion)

1. Topics (autogenerated keyword-aware pages)
2. Articles (collection of subtopics where the posts within can be voted up/down)
3. Questions+Discussions [the general case]

Nonforum version on Rum is going well.
Sente works on nesferado build to send messages back and forth client/server.
Currently working on making the rest of it go smoothly: means getting Rum and posts/displays/all UI screens to look legit.

Most recently, got nested comments to render correctly, which is just one aspect of the whole shebang.

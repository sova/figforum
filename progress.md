Nonforum version on Rum is going well.
Sente works on nesferado build to send messages back and forth client/server.
Currently working on making the rest of it go smoothly: means getting Rum and posts/displays/all UI screens to look legit.

Most recently, got nested comments to render correctly, which is just one aspect of the whole shebang.

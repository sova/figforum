                          means that for articles, each subtopic is an NF thread.
 + books
 + speeches
 + letters
[+ topics
 + articles [listed, context-specifically-ranked subtopics]
 + questions+discussions]


 context-specific ratings!

 means that we need a new way to host each type of topic/article/q+d
so ... ratings must therefore be context-specific.





Autopopulate new submissions with potential entries, label them as such (autopopulated) until they get votes of their own, otherwise they stay kinda muted/gray (autofilled in from other parts of the forum)

adding authentication is the next step
https://funcool.github.io/buddy-sign/latest/

  https://funcool.github.io/buddy-auth/latest/#example-session

  buddy-sign and buddy-auth

So yeah what else....

once there is authentication (nf, go, fb, tw) then let's focus on thread+comments
(question + discussion)

1. Topics (autogenerated keyword-aware pages)
2. Articles (collection of subtopics where the posts within can be voted up/down)
3. Questions+Discussions [the general case]

 + have got color coding of nested parent/child sets.
 + have got the CSS present for highlighting a freshly added comment.
 + would like to learn how to adjust rum for those :component-will-mount times.

Nonforum version on Rum is going well.
Sente works on nesferado build to send messages back and forth client/server.
Currently working on making the rest of it go smoothly: means getting Rum and posts/displays/all UI screens to look legit.

Most recently, got nested comments to render correctly, which is just one aspect of the whole shebang.

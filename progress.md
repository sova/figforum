                          means that for articles, each subtopic is an NF thread.
 + books
 + speeches
 + letters
[+ topics
 + articles [listed, context-specifically-ranked subtopics]
 + questions+discussions]


 context-specific ratings!

 means that we need a new way to host each type of topic/article/q+d
so ... ratings must therefore be context-specific.





Autopopulate new submissions with potential entries, label them as such (autopopulated) until they get votes of their own, otherwise they stay kinda muted/gray (autofilled in from other parts of the forum)




q+d
 collection of comments

books/speeches/letters
  collection of threads
    thread is a collection of comments

article
  collection of subtopics (named by user, voted on by others, autocompleted with other forum bits to start, each subtopic takes on life as its own thread)

topics
  simplest, keyword autogenerated pages



So in every Thread_ID or Subtopic_Name there must be a collection of ratings with userid, rating, timestamp, and if applicable the item being rated (sometimes eponymous).

Ratings calculated on the fly, and also shared over the wire to keep things as real-time as possible.






+-> archive versions of this stuff

archives.nonforum.com / thing id / all de best ?  generated once a year? i duno. somet coo



+ NOTIFICATIONS

easy enough, right?
if there are users in the immediate parent comment, give the ma notification (and a link to) the place where somebody posted.....

{:notification-comment-id 22228}

   something like that

single-burn use is fine, or burn-tolerant like facebook nonsense is okay too. maybe "times viewed" must reach a threshold until "marked read" or something?

anyway

what else... when notifications are not of the variety of immediate comments, then they are of the variety of new posts available in threads you created, new upvotes, new downvotes?  maybe notify maybe not.  for mentions by name (! userid?) there shall be some notifications.

adding authentication is the next step
https://funcool.github.io/buddy-sign/latest/

  https://funcool.github.io/buddy-auth/latest/#example-session

  buddy-sign and buddy-auth

So yeah what else....

once there is authentication (nf, go, fb, tw) then let's focus on thread+comments
(question + discussion)

1. Topics (autogenerated keyword-aware pages)
2. Articles (collection of subtopics where the posts within can be voted up/down)
3. Questions+Discussions [the general case]

 + have got color coding of nested parent/child sets.
 + have got the CSS present for highlighting a freshly added comment.
 + would like to learn how to adjust rum for those :component-will-mount times.

Nonforum version on Rum is going well.
Sente works on nesferado build to send messages back and forth client/server.
Currently working on making the rest of it go smoothly: means getting Rum and posts/displays/all UI screens to look legit.

Most recently, got nested comments to render correctly, which is just one aspect of the whole shebang.
